# Arachne

Executive Summary 
Project Arachne tackles the challenge of unlocking insights from Web3.0's complex data by building a knowledge graph rooted in Semantic Web principles. This WKG leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract meaning from various sources like blockchains and social media. By applying Semantic Web technologies, Project Arachne goes beyond simply organizing data. It builds a web of interconnected information, where data points are enriched with meaning and relationships, empowering researchers, developers, and investors with a user-friendly interface to explore trends, identify connections, and make informed decisions within the ever-growing Web3.0 ecosystem.

Process Goal
Project Arachne's process goals focus on securing timely data acquisition from key Web3.0 platforms. This data will be meticulously cleaned, normalized, and analyzed using NLP models with targeted accuracy. A multi-dimensional classification system will be built to categorize the data, followed by the construction of a functional WKG prototype leveraging Semantic Web formats. All this will occur within set timeframes, alongside development of a user-friendly interface for data exploration.

Functional Goal
Project Arachne's core function is to build a comprehensive and user-friendly Web3.0 Knowledge Graph (WKG). This WKG will empower researchers, developers, and investors by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to unlock valuable insights from the vast and complex data within the Web3.0 ecosystem. By extracting meaning and relationships from this data, the WKG transforms it into actionable information. A user-friendly interface allows for exploration and discovery of trends, connections, and hidden patterns within the data. Ultimately, Project Arachne equips users with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions within the ever-evolving Web3.0 landscape.
